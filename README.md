# Stock Market Prediction

This project is a Streamlit application for predicting stock market prices using a pre-trained Keras model. It provides historical stock data visualization along with price comparisons for moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200) and predicts future stock prices based on the historical trends of the selected stock.

## Project Overview
This project allows users to enter a stock symbol (e.g., IBM) and view historical stock data, as well as predicted prices generated by a pre-trained LSTM model. Moving Averages (50-day, 100-day, and 200-day) are displayed for trend analysis, and the application predicts future prices based on past data.

## Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical stock data for any given symbol using Yahoo Finance API.
- **Moving Averages Visualization**: Displays charts comparing stock prices with MA50, MA100, and MA200.
- **Price Prediction**: Predicts future prices based on a pre-trained LSTM model.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction and visualization.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naveedon16/Naveedon16.github.io
   cd Stock_Market_Prediction
